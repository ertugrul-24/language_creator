## Success Stories (Target)

### 6-Month Success Story

"I've taught 20 students my language 'Thalassan' for $19.99 each. LinguaFabric made it so easy to organize lessons and track progress. I'm earning $200/month from teaching now, and the community feedback has been amazing. I plan to create 2 more courses."

### 12-Month Success Story

"Our collaborative team of 8 people designed 'Valtharon' together on LinguaFabric. We published 3 courses, attracted 100+ students, and earned $5,000 in revenue in the first 6 months. The collaboration features are incredible - we can all edit simultaneously and track who contributed what. It's transformed how we think about collaborative creation."
